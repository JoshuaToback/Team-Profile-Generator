  ## Description
  Do you have a team of programmers and interns (who are preferrably into programming) who need to be showcased? Well, using OOP and node you can generate a team splash page fit for whatever size your squad is! 
  ## Installation
  Make sure you have Node installed on your PC/Mac. Then, download the repository and open Git Bash or your Terminal. After that, you're ready to go! 

  You can watch a walkthrough of how to use the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6vJrTXUC80)!

  ## Usage
  After you have Git Bash open, use code . to open up the repository in VS Code. Then in the terminal, type npm start and you can start building your team!

  If everything is insalled correctly, it should look like this! ![npmStart](/Images/npmStart.png)

  After that, start filling out the questions as they pop up. Describe your manager (as seen here) and then press enter! You'll then be presented with the option to add an engineer or intern to your team.

  Add an engineer the same way you filled out the manager's info.

  Remember to use the arrow keys to select an engineer or intern! You can add them in any order, they're all stored and organized in the same array!

  Once your team is finished, select done. Then team.html will automatically update and your team will be on display for the world to see!

  All of the links are clickable and will redirect you to either a new email message or the github page of the engineer!
