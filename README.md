  Do you have a team of programmers and interns (who are preferrably into programming) who need to be showcased? Well, using OOP and node you can generate a team splash page fit for whatever size your squad is!

  Make sure you have Node installed on your PC/Mac. Then, download the repository and open Git Bash or your Terminal. After that, you're ready to go!

  After you have Git Bash open, use code . to open up the repository in VS Code. Then in the terminal, type node index.js and then you'll be on your way!
